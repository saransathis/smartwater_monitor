NOTE:where there is no required components for simulation in wokwi,tinkercad.we used potentiometer as demo for ph sensor the ph value will be given from the user when the ph(potentimeter) is high than 8.5 the led will blink and 
buzzer will beep.we even add more sensor like tds turbidity and water temperature sensor
